# Astral-Pathfinder
A real-time space sim game written in C++ with the SDL2 library. Final project for A.I. Game Programming, Spring 2018.
Created and owned by [Logan Harvell](https://github.com/LoganTHarvell), collaboration by [Ian Holdeman](https://github.com/iholdeman1).

## About Project
The Astral Pathfinder project initially began as a text-based game inspired by on an old resource management simulation called [Hammurabi](http://www.hammurabigame.com/hammurabi-game.php "Hammurabi"). It was developed as the final project for Introduction to C Programming in Fall 2015, thus it was developed in C as a command line tool application. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/LoganTHarvell/Astral-Pathfinder-Command-Line-Prototype).

By Spring 2018, the project was reinvented as a real-time application developed in C++ using SDL2 and associated frameworks as the semester project for AI for Game Programming. The game evolved into a space conquest space sim game.

Currently it is still in development for MacOS as an Xcode project, but by utilizing non-platform specfic code, the project is easily adaptible for other platforms.
