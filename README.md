# Astral Pathfinder
A real-time space sim game written in C++ with the SDL2 library and a Lua interface for data and scripting.
Created and owned by [Logan Harvell](https://github.com/LoganTHarvell), collaboration by [Ian Holdeman](https://github.com/iholdeman1).

## About Project
The Astral Pathfinder project initially began as a text-based game inspired by on an old resource management simulation called [Hammurabi](http://www.hammurabigame.com/hammurabi-game.php "Hammurabi"). It was conceived as the final project for Introduction to C Programming in Fall 2015, thus it was developed in C as a command line application. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/LoganTHarvell/Astral-Pathfinder-Command-Line-Prototype).

By Spring 2018, the project was entirely reinvented from scratch as a real-time application developed in C++ using SDL2 and associated frameworks as the semester project for AI for Game Programming. The game evolved into a space conquest simulator.

As the creator, Logan Harvell handled conception and design. He also acted as the project lead managing, planning, and writing documentation for Astral Pathfinder. As a developer, Logan worked on data structures, logic, and aritficial intelligence, and, besides the UI, wrote most of the supporting engine, including a Lua interface used in creating a data driven system.

As a collaborator, Ian Holdeman lead the development of the user interface (UI) for Astral Pathfinder. He handled the development of most screens used by the project and all of the UI elements. Additionally, he worked on graphics rendering and input handling, including both UI and player controls.

Currently it is still in development for MacOS as an Xcode project, but by utilizing non-platform specific code, the project is easily adaptable for other platforms.
